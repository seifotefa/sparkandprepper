## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed
- Firebase project & Gemini API key

### Installation

You'll need **two terminals**: one for the backend server and another for the frontend client.

---

#### 🖥️ Terminal 1: Backend Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/seifotefa/sparkandprepper.git
cd sparkandprepper

# Go into backend folder
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the backend server
node server.js
```

---

#### 🖥️ Terminal 2: Frontend Setup

```bash
# Open a new terminal
cd sparkandprepper

# Go into frontend folder
cd sparkandpepper_frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the frontend app
npm run dev
```

---

3. **Set up Firebase and API keys:**

Create a `.env` file and add:

```env
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

```firebaseKey.json
your firebaseKey in json format
```

4. **Run the app:**

```bash
npm run dev
```
in the frontend 

## 📚 How It Works

- Users upload their course materials.
- Backend (Node.js + Express) sends files to the **Gemini API**.
- Gemini processes and creates custom study guides, flashcards, and quizzes.
- Firebase stores uploaded files and user data.
- Frontend displays interactive tools to help users study.

## 📖 Challenges Faced

- Gemini API integration across multiple file types
